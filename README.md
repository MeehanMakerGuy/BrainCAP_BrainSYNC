This repo contains the code and documentation for a personalized neurofeedback system. There is an arduino sketch that needs to be run on the headgear that is pulling EEG samples from a Mindflex. The processing sketch is an Android application that receives the data via Bluetooth and stores it to the internal SD card on any android device.
